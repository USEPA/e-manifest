# e-Manifest NPM package

## Intro

The [emanifest npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emanifest) is an API client library.
It simplifies the task of using the RCRAInfo/e-Manifest web services by abstracting the 
authentication process, providing developer friendly API, and exporting TypeScript types.
It's built on top of the [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) library, and can be used in both Node and browser 
runtime environments (EPA has discussed making some public API available that do not need authentication in the near future).

## Installation

```bash 
  $ npm install emanifest 
  or
  $ yarn add emanifest
```
## Basic Usage

The primary export of the `emanifest` package is the `newClient` function.
A constructor that accepts a configuration object and returns a new `RcraClient` 
instance. 

```typescript
import { AxiosResponse } from 'axios';
import { newClient, RCRAINFO_PREPROD, AuthResponse } from 'emanifest'

// The newClient accepts an instance of the RcraClientConfig which follows this interface
// interface RcraClientConfig {
// apiBaseURL?: RcrainfoEnv; // default: RCRAINFO_PREPROD
// apiID?: string;
// apiKey?: string;
// authAuth?: Boolean; // default: false
// }

const rcrainfo = newClient({ apiBaseURL: RCRAINFO_PREPROD, apiID: 'my_api_id', apiKey: 'my_api_key' })
const authResponse: AxiosResponse<AuthResponse> = await rcrainfo.authenticate()
console.log(authResponse.data)

```

### Other Exports 

The emanifest package also exports the `RCRAINFO_PREPROD` and `RCRAINFO_PROD` constants which can be used to set 
the `apiBaseURL` property of the `RcraClientConfig` object.

### Types

The emanifest package exports a types/interfaces that can be used in statically typed projects.
The types follow the OpenAPI schema definitions that can be found in the [USEPA/e-manifest schema directory](https://github.com/USEPA/e-manifest/tree/master/Services-Information/Schema)
however, some names have been modified for clarity (for example `RcraCode` instead of simply `Code`).


## Auto-Authentication

The `emanifest` package can be explicitly configured to automatically authenticate when needed.

```typescript
import { AxiosResponse } from 'axios';
import { newClient, RCRAINFO_PREPROD, AuthResponse, RcraClientClass, RcraCode } from 'emanifest'

const rcrainfo = newClient({
  apiBaseURL: RCRAINFO_PREPROD,
  apiID: 'my_api_id',
  apiKey: 'my_api_key',
  autoAuth: true // Set the RcraClient to automatically authenticate as needed
})

// the authenticate method is NOT explicitly called
const resp: AxtiosResponse<RcraCode> = await rcrainfo.getStateWasteCodes('VA')

console.log(resp.data) // [ { code: 'BCRUSH', description: 'Bulb or Lamp Crusher' } ]

console.log(rcrainfo.isAuthenticated()) // true

```
