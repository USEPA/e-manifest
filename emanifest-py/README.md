**emanifest** is a client library for accessing the e-Manifest REST APIs of the US Environmental Protection Agency's
RCRAInfo national electronic hazardous waste management system.

**Note:** The **emanifest** package was substantially refactored after version 2.0.7 and was released as a new major
version at 3.0.0. Code relying on versions â‰¤3.0.0 should not upgrade to version 3.0.0 of this package without
refactoring.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7

## Installation

**emanifest** can be installed directly from the Python package Index (PyPI) using pip:

```shell
$ pip install emanifest
```

## Getting Started

Before using the **emanifest** package, ensure you have a RCRAInfo user account and
the [necessary permissions](https://www.epa.gov/e-manifest/frequent-questions-about-e-manifest#user_question6) to
generate an API ID and key.

All methods to access the e-Manifest APIs are implemented by the `RcrainfoClient` class which needs your API ID and Key
to authenticate. A new instance of the class can be initiated like so:

```python
from emanifest import RcrainfoClient

rcrainfo = RcrainfoClient('preprod', api_id='YOUR_API_ID', api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')
```

And that's it! You're ready to start using the RCRAInfo Restful web services.

The RcrainfoClient class requires one positional argument, a string, either `'preprod'`, or `'prod'`.

### Authentication

Starting with version 3.0 and above of this package, the RcrainfoClient will automatically authenticate as needed once
API credentials have been provided, either during object initiation or by passing the API ID and key to
the `authenticate` method.

If you'd like to disable this behaviour, you can set the RcrainfoClient `auto_renew = False`, and call
the `authenticate` method as necessary.

```python
from emanifest import RcrainfoClient

rcrainfo = RcrainfoClient('preprod', auto_renew=False)
# or
rcrainfo.auto_renew = False

# Returns False if no token present, or has expired.
if not rcrainfo.is_authenticated:
    rcrainfo.authenticate(api_id='my_api_id', api_key='my_api_key')
    # If RcrainfoClient already has your API credentials, you don't need to them supply again.
    rcrainfo.authenticate()
```

The RcrainfoClient stores the JSON web token and its expiration period (20 minutes). See
the [`RcrainfoClient` definition here](/emanifest-py/src/emanifest/client.py) for more details.

### Methods

After providing your API credentials, you are ready to use the full functionality of the emanifest package. The
RcrainfoClient class exposes a method for each API endpoint following an `<action>_<resource>` naming convention.

#### Examples:

RCRAInfo endpoints that require a URL parameter should be passed as a string to the RcrainfoClient method.

```python
from emanifest import RcrainfoClient

rcrainfo = RcrainfoClient('preprod', api_id='YOUR_API_ID', api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')

# Any endpoint with URL parameters will take that parameter as a positional, string argument.
site_resp = rcrainfo.get_site('VATEST000001')
```

Many of the POST request use keyword arguments to compose the http request's body. for example...

```python
from emanifest import RcrainfoClient

rcrainfo = RcrainfoClient('preprod', api_id='YOUR_API_ID', api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')

resp = rcrainfo.search_mtn(siteId='VATEST000001', status='InTransit')
```

would send a http requests with the following body to the manifest tracking number (mtn) search endpoint.

```json
{
  "siteId": "VATEST000001",
  "status": "InTransit"
}
```

Note, the keyword arguments use the same naming convention seen in the RCRAInfo swagger pages and documentation.

`multipart/mixed` payloads (
e.g., [JSON of a manifest](https://github.com/USEPA/e-manifest/tree/master/Services-Information/Schema/manifest-save-return-examples)
and [.zip file of attachments](https://github.com/USEPA/e-manifest/tree/master/Services-Information)) can be uploaded to
RCRAInfo
by passing a JSON string and the bytes of the optional attachment like so:

```python
from emanifest import RcrainfoClient

rcrainfo = RcrainfoClient('preprod', api_id='YOUR_API_ID', api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')

# The JSON and .zip file could come from a database, filesystem, an external service,
# or json.dumps({'manifestTrackingNumber': '0123456789ELC', ... }) 
with open('./attachments.zip', 'rb') as f:
    attachment = f.read()
with open('./manifest.json', 'r') as f:
    manifest_json = f.read()

resp = rcrainfo.update_manifest(manifest_json, attachment)
```

Responses are returned as a RcraResponse object, which wraps around
the [requests library](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
Response object. Methods that download file attachments can be accessed via the
```RcrainfoResponse.json()``` method and ```RcrainfoResponse.zip``` property when appropriate. The
entire ```request.Response``` object is returned in ```RcrainfoResponse.response```.

```python
from emanifest import RcrainfoClient

rcrainfo = RcrainfoClient('preprod', api_id='YOUR_API_ID', api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')

resp = rcrainfo.get_manifest_attachments('123456789ELC')

# RcraInfoResponse re-exports a couple attributes of the requests.Response object.
print(resp.ok)
# Or you can access the full Response like such...
print(resp.response.json())
# For endpoints that return multipart/mixed bodies, you can access JSON with the resp.json()
downloaded_json = resp.json()
# The .zip file can be accessed in the resp.zip property.
downloaded_attachment = resp.zip
```

### Regulators

Starting with version 3.0 and above of this package, regulator can use the same methods as industry but with
the `reg` keyword argument set to `True`. For example:

```python
from emanifest import RcrainfoClient

rcrainfo = RcrainfoClient('preprod', api_id='YOUR_API_ID', api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')

resp = rcrainfo.get_manifest('123456789ELC', reg=True)
```

The `reg` keyword argument is set to `False` by default.
The following methods have regulator options:

1. get_manifest_attachments
2. search_mtn
3. get_correction
4. get_correction_version
5. get_site_mtn
6. get_manifest
7. get_sites

The following methods are for regulator users only:

1. get_handler
2. get_cme_lookups
3. get_cme_indicators
4. get_cme_types

API endpoints designed for use by other groups, such as regulators or industry users, will return 'Access Denied' errors
if you are not authorized to access these resources in RCRAInfo.

### Advanced Usage and Help

As of version 3.0, the RcrainfoClient is a subclass of
the [requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
[Session Class](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#session-objects). As such,
you can take advantage of its functionality.

RcrainfoClient can be also customized by subclassing and overriding. For example,

```python
from emanifest import RcrainfoClient


class MyClass(RcrainfoClient):
    def retrieve_id(self, api_id=None) -> str:
        # Custom behavior to retrieve your RCRAInfo API ID 
        my_api_id = 'api_id_from_someplace_secure'
        return super().retrieve_id(my_api_id)
```

For RcrainfoClient method specific documentation, you can use the `help()` function from the Python console to get a
description of
each method and its inputs.

```
>>> from emanifest import RcrainfoClient
>>> help(RcrainfoClient.get_bill)
```

For more information about the RCRAInfo services, see the documentation
in the [root directory of the e-Manifest GitHub repo](https://github.com/USEPA/e-manifest), and the Swagger page of your
selected
environment ([Preproduction](https://rcrainfopreprod.epa.gov/rcrainfo/secured/swagger/), [Production](https://rcrainfo.epa.gov/rcrainfoprod/secured/swagger/)).
Do not use the RCRAInfo Production environment for testing. To register for a testing
account in preproduction, visit the [preprod site](https://rcrainfopreprod.epa.gov/rcrainfo/action/secured/login).

Please note, the API of emanifest python package was substantially modified from version 2.0 to 3.0. We intend for the
3.0 package version to be much more stable than its predecessors. We will continue to adhere to semantic versioning,
and will not break backwards compatibility within a major release.
