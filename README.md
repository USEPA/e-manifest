# e-Manifest

**You can find our new services documentation
at [https://usepa.github.io/e-manifest/](https://usepa.github.io/e-manifest/)**

## Background

The purpose of e-Manifest is to establish a national information technology system that will enable the
Agency and the hazardous waste programâ€™s industry and state stakeholders to transition the manifest system from one
that is paper-intensive and burdensome to a system that is much more efficient, because it will rely on information
technology to track hazardous waste shipments.
