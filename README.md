# e-Manifest

## Background

The overarching purpose of e-Manifest is to establish a national information technology system that will enable the Agency and the hazardous waste program’s industry and state stakeholders to transition the manifest system from one that is paper-intensive and burdensome to a system that is much more efficient, because it will rely on information technology to track hazardous waste shipments.
