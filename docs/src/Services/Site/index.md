The site services allow third-party applications to gather information about sites registered in the e-Manifest system.
The site services are read-only and do not allow third-party applications to create, update, or delete sites. User
looking to update information about their site can do so through the RCRAInfo UI, if their state has opted into using
the RCRAInfo myRCRAid module, or through their state.
