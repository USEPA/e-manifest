the following information about the manifest:

- If the manifest status is before `Signed` then no manifest versions associated with the manifest will be returned
- If the manifest status is `Signed` and neither `Corrected` nor `UnderCorrection` versions were created then the
  service will return information about the `Signed` version of the manifest.
- If the manifest status is `Corrected` then the service will return information about `Signed` version and all `
Corrected` versions of the manifest.
- If the manifest status is `UnderCorrection` then the service will return information about the `Signed` version of the
  manifest, the `UnderCorrection` version and all `Corrected` versions of the manifest (if any `Corrected` versions were
  created).

Depending on the on manifest Paper Processing Center (PPC) status the service can return the following information about
the manifest versions associated with the PPC processing:

- If ppc status is `Draft` or `DataEntryInProgress` or `PendingDataQc` or `PendingDataQa` then
  no manifest versions associated with PPC processing will be returned
  If PPC status is either `PendingDataEntry` or `DataQaCompleted` then the service will return
  information about the manifest version(s) created for PPC processing.
