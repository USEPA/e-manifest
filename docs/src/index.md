# e-Manifest

June 30, 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA or EPA) launched a national system for tracking
hazardous waste shipments electronically, this system, known as "e-Manifest," modernizes the nationâ€™s paper-intensive
process for tracking hazardous waste from cradle to grave while saving valuable time, resources, and dollars for
industry and states.

e-Manifest is a component of EPA's [Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)](https://www.epa.gov/rcra) information
system, called RCRAInfo.
e-Manifest can be accessed by its users in two ways:

1. Through their favorite web browser at [https://rcrainfo.epa.gov/](https://rcrainfo.epa.gov/)

2. Via the RCRAInfo RESTful application programming interface (API)

e-Manifest data is also publicly available 90-days after the manifest completed, or uploaded in the case of a paper
manifest, on [RCRAInfo Web](https://rcrapublic.epa.gov/rcrainfoweb/action/main-menu/view).
