# The Manifest

The Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest (AKA "manifest" or EPA form 8700-22) is form required by EPA and U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) for all hazardous waste generators who transport hazardous waste for off-site treatment, recycling, storage or disposal. When completed, the form contains information on the type and quantity of the waste being transported, instructions for handling the waste, and signature lines
for all parties involved in the disposal process. This process ensures critical accountability in the transportation and disposal processes of hazardous waste from cradle-to-grave.

## Paper Manifests

Since the inception of the uniform manifest, the manifesting process was completed on
[NCR paper](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=NCR+paper#ip=1) often refered to
as carbon-copy paper. Each party that handles the waste signs the manifest and retains a copy for themselves.
Once the waste reaches its destination, the receiving facility returns a signed copy to the generator, confirming that the waste has been received by the designated facility.

Today, the paper manifest comes in a [5 carbon-copy form](<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/chapter-I/subchapter-I/part-262#p-262.21(f)(6)>) (1 manifest, 5 copies). Only [registered manifest printers](https://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/hazardous-waste-manifest-system#printer) can print paper manifest (you can print paper copies of electronic manifest, more on this later). EPA established this procedure, in part, to ensure that each manifest has a unique identifying string called the Manifest Tracking Number (MTN).

All paper manifests that accompany waste that requires manifesting (whether the waste is federally regualted or state regualted in the generatoring or receiving state) must be submitted to the e-Manifest system by the designated receving facility. The Receiving facility is required to pay a fee, the amount depends on the submission type and the current e-Manifest fees.
